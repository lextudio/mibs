This MIB view is actually composed of information which is distributed between modules within the chassis but is able to be viewed as a collective whole. When a module is in standalone mode, it only supports original, module-level mibs. In distributed mode, the module will operate in conjunction with other distributed modules to share management information and present it to management clients through the chassis ip. 0 = STANDALONE 1 = DISTRIBUTED "
