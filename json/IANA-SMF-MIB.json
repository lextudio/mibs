There are basically three styles of SMF operation with reduced relay sets currently identified: Independent operation 'independent(1)' - SMF performs its own relay set selection using information from an associated MANET NHDP process. CDS-aware unicast routing operation 'routing(2)'- a coexistent unicast routing protocol provides dynamic relay set state based upon its own control plane Connected Dominating Set (CDS) or neighborhood discovery information. Cross-layer operation 'crossLayer(3)' - SMF operates using neighborhood status and triggers from a cross-layer information base for dynamic relay set selection and maintenance. IANA MUST update this Textual Convention accordingly. The definition of this Textual Convention with the addition of newly assigned values is updated periodically by the IANA, in the IANA-maintained registries.

    "description": "An index that identifies through reference to specific RSSAs. Several are currently defined in the Appendices A, B, and C of RFC 6621. Examples of RSSAs already identified within this Textual Convention (TC) are: Classical Flooding (cF(1)) - is the standard flooding algorithm where each node in the next retransmits the information on each of its interfaces. Source-Based Multipoint Relay (sMPR(2)) - this algorithm is used by Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) and OLSR version 2 (OLSRv2) protocols for the relay of link state updates and other control information (RFC 3626, RFC 7181). Since each router picks its neighboring relays independently, sMPR forwarders depend upon previous hop information (e.g., source Media Access Control (MAC) address) to operate correctly. Essential Connected Dominating Set (eCDS(3)) - defined in RFC 5614, this algorithm forms a single CDS mesh for the SMF operating region. Its packet-forwarding rules are not dependent upon previous hop knowledge in contrast to sMPR. Multipoint Relay Connected Dominating Set (mprCDS(4)) - This algorithm is an extension to the basic sMPR election algorithm that results in a shared (non-source-specific) SMF CDS. Thus, its forwarding rules are not dependent upon previous hop information, similar to eCDS. IANA MUST update this Textual Convention accordingly. The definition of this Textual Convention with the addition of newly assigned values is updated periodically by the IANA, in the IANA-maintained registries.
