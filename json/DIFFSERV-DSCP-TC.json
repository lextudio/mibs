When a MIB is used for configuration, an object with this SYNTAX always contains a legal value (if non-zero) for an index that is not currently used in the relevant table. The Command Generator (Network Management Application) reads this variable and uses the (non-zero) value read when creating a new row with an SNMP SET. When the SET is performed, the Command Responder (agent) must determine whether the value is indeed still unused; Two Network Management Applications may attempt to create a row (configuration entry) simultaneously and use the same value. If it is currently unused, the SET succeeds and the Command Responder (agent) changes the value of this object, according to an implementation-specific algorithm. If the value is in use, however, the SET fails. The Network Management Application must then re-read this variable to obtain a new usable value. An OBJECT-TYPE definition using this SYNTAX MUST specify the relevant table for which the object is providing this functionality."
