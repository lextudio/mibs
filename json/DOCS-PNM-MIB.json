    "description": "The purpose of downstream symbol capture is to provide partial functionality of a network analyzer to analyze the response of the cable plant from the CM's perspective. At the CM, the received I and Q time-domain samples of one full OFDM symbol before the FFT, not including the guard interval, are captured and made available for analysis. This capture will result in a number of data points equal to the FFT length in use, time aligned for receiver FFT processing. The number of captured samples can be reduced for narrower channels if the sampling rate, which is implementation dependent, is reduced. The capture includes a bit indicating if receiver windowing effects are present in the data. The time domain samples are expressed as 16 bit two's complement numbers using s3.12 format. The CM samples are scaled such that the average power of the samples is approximately 1, in order to avoid excessive clipping and quantization noise. Capturing the input and output of the cable plant is equivalent to a wideband sweep of the channel, which permits full characterization of the linear and nonlinear response of the downstream plant. The MAC provides signaling via the PLC Trigger Message to ensure that the same symbol is captured at the CMTS and CM. The Downstream Symbol Capture is controlled by setting the 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymTrigEnable' object. The status of the capture is obtained by reading the value of the 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymMeasStatus' object. This table will have a row for each ifIndex for the modem. "

The CM calculates the Required Average MER based on the bit loading for the profile and the Required MER per Modulation Order provided in the RequiredDsOfdmQamMer Table. The CM then measures the RxMER per subcarrier and calculates the Average MER for the Active Subcarriers used in the Profile and stores the value as MeasuredAvgMer. The CM also counts the number of MER per Subcarrier values that are below the threshold determined by the Required MER for the Modulation Order and the ThrshldOffset. The CM reports that value as NumSubcarriersBelowThrshld. This table will have a row for each ifIndex for the modem. "

    "description": "The purpose of the downstream histogram is to provide a measurement of nonlinear effects in the channel such as amplifier compression and laser clipping. For example, laser clipping causes one tail of the histogram to be truncated and replaced with a spike. The CM captures the histogram of time domain samples at the wideband front end of the receiver (full downstream band). The histogram is two-sided; that is, it encompasses values from far-negative to far-positive values of the samples. The histogram will have a minimum of 255 or 256 equally spaced bins. These bins typically correspond to the 8 MSBs of the wideband analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for the case of 255 or 256 bins. The histogram dwell count, a 32-bit unsigned integer, is the number of samples observed while counting hits for a given bin, and may have the same value for all bins. The histogram hit count, a 32-bit unsigned integer, is the number of samples falling in a given bin. The CM reports the dwell count per bin and the hit count per bin. When enabled, the CM computes a histogram with a dwell of at least 10 million samples at each bin in 30 seconds or less. The CM continues accumulating histogram samples until it is restarted, disabled or times out. If the highest dwell count approaches its 32-bit overflow value, the CM stops counting and sets the docsPnmCmDsHistMeasStatus attribute to 'sampleReady'. The CM reports the capture time of the histogram measurement in the Header Elements of the file for TFTP download using the 32-bit Universal Time Code. This table will have a row for each docsCableMaclayer type ifIndex for the modem."

    "description": "This object provides access to CM upstream pre-equalizer coefficients. The CM pre-equalizer coefficients and the CMTS upstream adaptive equalizer coefficient update values, when taken together describe the linear response of the upstream cable plant for a given CM. During the ranging process, the CMTS computes adaptive equalizer coefficients based on upstream probes; these coefficients describe the residual channel remaining after any pre-equalization. The CMTS sends these equalizer coefficients to the CM as a set of Transmit Equalization Adjust coefficients as part of the ranging process. The CM Pre-Equalizer coefficients are expressed as 16 bit two's complement numbers using s2.13 format. The power averaged over all coefficients approximately 1, in order to avoid excessive clipping and quantization noise. The Pre-Equalizer coefficient update values sent to the CM by the CMTS in the RNG-RSP are expressed as 16 bit two's complement numbers using s1.14 format. The CM provides the capability to report its upstream pre-equalizer coefficients (full set or summary) upon request. The CM also provides the capability to also report the most recent set of Transmit Equalization Adjust coefficients which were applied to produce the reported set of upstream pre-equalizer coefficients. The CM indicates the status of the most recent Transmit Equalization Adjust coefficients sent to it by the CMTS. If the CM was able to apply the coefficients it sets the status to success(2). If the CM was unable to fully apply the adjustments (for example, due to excess tilt or ripple in the channel), and it was necessary for the CM to clip the coefficients, it sets the status to clipped(3). If the CM modified the coefficients other than by simply clipping them, it sets the status to other(1). If for some reason the CM is unable to apply the adjustments at all, it sets the status to rejected(4). The 'docsPnmCmUsPreEqFileEnable' object is used to create files. Other objects are updated as read. This table will have a row for each ifIndex for the modem."

If a default filename value is used, it is generated as the test name plus the CM MAC Address plus the 'epoch time'. The epoch time (also known as 'unix time') is defined as the number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970. Hence, the format would be: PNMSpecAnData_<CM MAC address>_<epoch> For example: PNMSpecAnData_0010181A2D11_1403405123 The data file is comprised of a header plus the Spectrum Analysis Data. The header is comprised of ordered fixed-length fields. Unless otherwise specified, the header fields contain hex values that are right-justified within the field. If necessary the field is left-padded with zero values. Syntax of the file is as follows: File Type set to '504E4D09' (without the quotes) 4 bytes Capture Time 4 bytes Channel Id (use zero for this test) 1 byte CM MAC Address 6 bytes FirstSegmentCenterFrequency 4 bytes LastSegmentCenterFrequency 4 bytes SegmentFrequencySpan 4 bytes NumBinsPerSegment 2 bytes EquivalentNoiseBandWidth 2 bytes WindowFunction(SpectrumAnalysisWindowFunction enum) 2 bytes Length in bytes of SpecAnData that follows 4 bytes Spectrum Analysis Data BinAmplitudeFileData If the size of the data the CM is commanded to collect would exceed the maximum file-size limit of the data collection mechanism, the CM will limit the file size accordingly and set the 'MeasStatus' attribute to a value of 'sampleTruncated'. If this occurs, the file will contain valid data, from the beginning of the capture, but will represent fewer bins than configured for the measurement. "

    "description": "The DsOfdmSymbolCapture object capture provides partial functionality of a network analyzer to analyze the response of the cable plant. At the CMTS, the transmitted frequency-domain modulation values of one full OFDM symbol before the IFFT are captured and made available for analysis. The frequency domain samples are expressed as 16-bit two's complement numbers using s3.12 format. This includes the I and Q modulation values of all subcarriers in the active bandwidth of the OFDM channel, including data subcarriers, pilots, PLC preamble symbols and excluded subcarriers. This capture will result in a number of samples that depends on the OFDM channel width. As examples, for 50 kHz subcarrier spacing in a 192 MHz channel with 204.8 MHz sampling rate, 3800 samples will be captured; for 25 kHz subcarrier spacing in a 192 MHz channel with 204.8 MHz sampling rate, 7600 samples will be captured; for 50 kHz subcarrier spacing in a 24 MHz channel with a reduced sampling rate of 25.6 MHz, 475 samples would be captured. Note: Excluded subcarriers in the guard band on either side of the encompassed spectrum are not captured. Capturing the input and output of the cable plant is equivalent to a wideband sweep of the channel, which permits full characterization of the linear and nonlinear response of the downstream plant. The MAC provides signaling via the PLC Trigger Message to ensure that the same symbol is captured at the CMTS and CM. The Downstream Symbol Capture is controlled by setting the 'docsPnmCmtsDsOfdmSymTrigEnable' object. The status of the capture is obtained by reading the value of the 'docsPnmCmDsOfdmSymMeasStatus' object. "

As an out-of-service test, the CMTS can define an exclusion band of zero-valued subcarriers which forms a spectral notch in the downstream OFDM signal for all profiles of a given downstream channel. The CM provides its normal spectral capture measurements, or symbol capture, which permit analysis of the notch depth. A possible use case is to observe LTE interference occurring within an OFDM band; another is to observe intermodulation products resulting from signal-level alignment issues. Since the introduction and removal of a notch affects all profiles, causing possible link downtime, this feature is intended for infrequent maintenance. "

    "description": "The purpose of upstream capture is to measure plant response and view the underlying noise floor, by capturing at least one OFDMA symbol during a scheduled active or quiet probe. An active probe provides the partial functionality of a network analyzer, since the input is known and the output is captured. This permits full characterization of the linear and nonlinear response of the upstream cable plant. A quiet probe provides an opportunity to view the underlying noise and ingress while no traffic is being transmitted in the OFDMA band being measured. The PNM server selects an active CM to analyze by specifying its MAC address, or performs a quiet probe measurement. When enabled to perform the capture, the CMTS selects a specified transmitting CM, or quiet period when no CMs are transmitting, for the capture. The CMTS sets up the capture as described in MULPIv3.1, selecting either an active SID corresponding to the specified MAC address or the idle SID, and defining an active or quiet probe. The active probe symbol for this capture normally includes all non-excluded subcarriers across the upstream OFDMA channel, with pre-equalization on or off as specified in the MIB. The quiet probe symbol normally includes all subcarriers, that is, during the quiet probe time there are no transmissions in the given upstream OFDMA channel. For the quiet probe, the CMTS captures samples of at least one full OFDMA symbol including the guard interval. The CMTS begins the capture with the first symbol of the specified probe. The sample rate is the FFT sample rate (102.4 Msps). The CMTS reports the list of excluded subcarriers, the cyclic prefix length, and the transmit window rolloff period in order to fully define the transmitted waveform. The CMTS also reports the index of the starting sample used by the receiver for its FFT. For possible comparison with other events, the CMTS reports the timestamp corresponding to the beginning of the probe. In the case where the P-MAPs for the OFDMA upstream being analyzed are being sent in an OFDM downstream, the timestamp reported is the extended timestamp, while in a case with OFDMA upstream channels but no OFDM downstream channels, the reported timestamp is the D3.0 timestamp. For an active probe, the CMTS reports the contents of the Probe Information Element (P-IE) message describing that probe. "

    "description": "The Upstream Histogram provides a measurement of nonlinear effects in the channel such as amplifier compression and laser clipping. For example, laser clipping causes one tail of the histogram to be truncated and replaced with a spike. When the UpstreamHistogram Enable attribute is set to 'true', the CMTS will begin capturing the histogram of time domain samples at the wideband front end of the receiver (full upstream band). The histogram is two-sided; that is, it encompasses values from far-negative to far-positive values of the samples. The histogram will have a minimum of 255 or 256 equally spaced bins. These bins typically correspond to the 8 MSBs of the wideband analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for the case of 255 or 256 bins. The histogram dwell count, a 32-bit unsigned integer, is the number of samples observed while counting hits for a given bin, and may have the same value for all bins. The histogram hit count, a 32-bit unsigned integer, is the number of samples falling in a given bin. The CMTS will report the dwell count per bin and the hit count per bin. When enabled, the CMTS will compute a histogram with a dwell of at least 10 million samples at each bin in 30 seconds or less. The CMTS will continue accumulating histogram samples until it is restarted, disabled or times out. If the highest dwell count approaches its 32-bit overflow value, the CMTS will save the current set of histogram values and reset the histogram, so that in a steady-state condition a complete measurement is always available.

The CMTS measures the RxMER using an upstream probe, which is not subject to symbol errors as data subcarriers would be. The probes used for RxMER measurement are typically distinct from the probes used for pre-equalization adjustment. For the purposes of this measurement, RxMER is defined as the ratio of the average power of the ideal QAM constellation to the average error-vector power. The error vector is the difference between the equalized received probe value and the known correct probe value. If some subcarriers (such as exclusion bands) cannot be measured by the CMTS, the CMTS indicates that condition in the measurement data for those subcarriers. "

The CMTS can be made to use 100 kHz or better resolution (bin spacing) in the wideband upstream spectrum measurement.

It is also possible that the CMTS will provide the collection of time-domain input samples as an alternative to the frequency-domain upstream spectrum results.

Some tests will only require 1 test or maybe a combination of one or more tests. As a result, this table needs to be able to gather the needed data for each CM and provide that to the PMA. MER data from the CM will be recorded as a series of hex values (0x00 to 0xFF) that will represent the MER values that the CM has measured. These values are gathered from the first active subcarrier to the last active subcarrier in the OFDM channel definition. The data from the CM will not contain pairs of values (subcarrierId and MER value) but just the subcarrier MER value. For the PMA to make sense of the data, the CCAP must provide the first active subcarrier to allow the PMA to know where it should start associating the values from the CM to the individual subcarriers defined in the channel."

Each trigger mode requires the Enable attribute to be set to true as well as the proper configuration settings applied which are applicable to the specific trigger mode. other: The CCAP initiates sampling the upstream spectrum as the result of a trigger condition not defined in this specification. freeRunning: The CCAP immediately initiates sampling and continues sampling until the length of time configured in attribute FreeRunDuration has transpired. Sampling terminates when the length of time configured in FreeRunDuration has elapsed or when FFT is disabled. The interval between captures is RepeatPeriod, or the minimum period supported by the CCAP, whichever is greater. miniSlotCount: The CCAP initiates sampling when the minislot number equals the value configured for attribute MinislotCount. sid:The CCAP immediately initiates capturing samples corresponding to the Service Flow identified with the Service Identifier (SID) numbered with the value of attribute Sid. The CCAP continues to sample the configured upstream spectrum after being triggered on transmissions corresponding to the specified SID until FFT is disabled or a new configuration is applied. idleSid: The CCAP immediately initiates capturing samples during an idle period selected by the CCAP. The CCAP will continue to sample the configured upstream spectrum during transmissions corresponding to the idle SID until FFT is disabled or a new configuration is applied. cmMacAddr: The CCAP immediately initiates sampling data on a grant for any SID assigned to the cable modem whose MAC address is the value of attribute CmMac. The CCAP continues to sample the configured upstream spectrum during transmissions corresponding to the configured CM MAC until FFT is disabled or a new configuration is applied. quietProbeSymbol: The CCAP immediately initiates sampling data when a configured OFDMA Quiet Probe Symbol occurs. The CCAP will continue to sample the configured upstream spectrum during Quiet Probe Symbols until FFT is disabled or a new configuration is applied. The Upstream Triggered Spectrum Capture test with quietProbeSymbol trigger is different from the Upstream Capture for Active and Quiet Probes PNM feature in that the Upstream Triggered Spectrum Capture test is more general than the Upstream Capture for Active and Quiet Probes test. Upstream Triggered Spectrum Capture test can be done in any band, while the Upstream Capture for Active and Quiet Probes test is specifically for an OFDMA channel. burstIuc: The CCAP immediately initiates sampling when the CCAP issues the grant for the configured burst Interval Usage Code. The CCAP will continue to sample the configured upstream spectrum during transmissions corresponding to the configured IUC until FFT is disabled or a new configuration is applied. timestamp: The CCAP initiates sampling when the configured timestamp occurs. The CCAP will continue to sample the configured upstream spectrum until FFT is disabled or a new configuration is applied; however, a single capture typically is made in this mode. This is the DOCSIS 3.1 timestamp defined in MULPIv3.1. Note that if the CCAP supports only one set of Upstream Triggered Spectrum Capture configuration, then if a test is configured with timestamp trigger it effectively blocks any other test setup and execution until it completes since setting up the other test will overwrite the timestamp test configuration."
