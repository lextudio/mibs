    "description": "The Cisco Contact Center Applications (CCCA) Management Information Base (MIB) module defines management instrumentation for applications that deliver enterprise-wide intelligent contact routing, call treatment, network-to- desktop computer telephony integration (CTI), and multi-media (e.g. voice, email, chat) contact management over an IP infrastructure. Cisco enterprise contact center applications are distributed, fault-tolerant, contact routing and management solutions that encompass multiple, dependent host servers. Each host is capable of implementing one or more functions of the application. How many functions a single host is capable of providing is dependent upon capacity and/or performance limitations. However, the architecture supports virtually any combination. The main functional components of Cisco enterprise contact center applications are: 1. Router: The router component provides intelligent routing of inbound contacts, e.g. voice calls, emails, chat sessions, to contact center agents. A subcomponent of the router is the Network Interface Controller (NIC). A NIC, in the context of a Cisco enterprise contact center application, is a gateway to a voice telephony network. (A NIC here should not be confused with a network interface card on a host computer.) A router component can have one or more NIC subcomponents. 2. Logger: The logger component maintains the enterprise contact center solution configuration and real-time data store. 3. Administration and Data Server: The administration and data server provides access to configuration, historical and detailed data, serving one or more reporting clients or data archival or aggregation components. Note that this component was previously known as the Administrator Workstation (AW) (specifically, the Distributor AW). 4. Peripheral Gateway (PG): The PG provides an interface to one or more peripheral devices such as a private branch exchange (PBX), an automatic call distributor (ACD) or a voice response unit (VRU). A subcomponent of the PG is the Peripheral Interface Manager or 'PIM'. A PIM acts as a gateway between the PG and a single PBX or VRU. A PG may have multiple PIMs. 5. Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) Gateway (CG): The CTI gateway is the solution integration point for desktop CTI clients. The CTI client application exposes contact data served by the CG to the agent (via 'screen pops') and allows the agent to control the contact state, e.g. answer/hang-up or transfer voice calls, respond to emails or chat with contacts. 6. CTI Object Server (CTIOS): CTIOS, as compared to the CTI gateway, is a more intelligent and more scalable server for desktop CTI clients and offers a higher-level interface to those client applications. 7. Outbound Option (OO): Outbound Option is an optional, add-on product having two primary runtime components: the Campaign Manager and the Dialer. The Campaign Manager is deployed co-resident with the Logger while the Dialer is deployed co-resident with a Peripheral Gateway. No more than one instance of an Outbound Option component may be installed on a server. Each server of the enterprise contact center solution, regardless of its specific function, implements the contact center applications MIB, however, it only populates those tables that are appropriate for its specific function. Implementing the same MIB on all hosts simplifies the acquisition of management instrumentation from the entire contact center solution. The instrumentation in each table of this MIB provides three types of data: 1) dependent host addresses (for topology building), 2) critical configuration information that uniquely identifies the functional component and, 3) operational status instrumentation. The quantity of entries (i.e. rows) in the tables of this MIB is static while the application is running on the host; rows cannot be added or deleted at runtime by the management station.

The component is installed on two separate servers (a side A and a side B); one side is active while the other is on hot standby. Should a failure occur on one side, the other side will immediately activate and continue its function with virtually no loss in functionality. instance A collection of enterprise contact center application functional components that encompass a complete solution. simplex A term used herein to indicate that the functional component is not fault tolerant. The component is installed on a single server; if the component fails, the system will then be impaired or entirely non-functional."

To achieve fault tolerance, two separate, interconnected, dependent hosts (one identified as 'sideA' and the other identified as 'sideB') will implement the functional component; one host will be the 'active' side and the other will be the 'standby' side. The two hosts are considered to be a 'duplex pair' of a functional component. This syntax is used to identify the side (A or B) that this host represents of a duplex pair of an enterprise contact center fault tolerant functional component. That one side is identified as 'sideA' does not imply that the 'A' side is always the primary; at any given time, either side could be the 'active' side. Setting the side identifier is completely arbitrary; the side is designated when installed and configured by the system administrator. When an event occurs that causes a fail-over from one side to the other, the side which was the 'standby' side then becomes the 'active' side while the previously-active side thus becomes the standby side. Most often, when the fail-over occurs, the side which was 'active' initiates a restart and then comes back up as the 'standby' side. The standby side is completely aware of the current status of the enterprise contact center application and is ready to assume functional responsibility immediately when instructed. When a fail-over occurs, there is little, if any, loss of functionality or context. Typically, a system impairment or failure event will cause a fail-over to occur but an administrator can initiate a fail- over by deliberately stopping the active side of a functional component."

A single server is permitted to have multiple functional components of a different type, but also multiple components of the same type, each of which may be part of a different instance. A perfect example of the latter is in a telephony service provider environment where a single server could have ten router components, each assigned to a different 'customer' instance. All ten are concurrently functional but route contacts only within the context of the instance that they are assigned. In this scenario, the instance table would have ten entries. The instance table is not directly dependent upon any other table, however, the other functional component tables are dependent upon the instance table. The instance table index serves as a primary index for all other functional component tables in order to properly relate the functional components to the appropriate instance. The SNMP agent constructs the instance table at startup. Since instances can only be configured while the enterprise contact center application is stopped, instance table entries cannot be added to or deleted from the table nor can object values be modified either by the agent or the management station.

    "description": "The component element table provides a list of component (operating system) services or processes that are elements of an enterprise contact center application functional component. Each entry identifies a single process that is a necessary element of the functional component. This table also provides a one-to-one mapping of entries to a corresponding entry in IETF standard host and application MIB tables. The HOST-RESOURCES and SYSAPPL MIBs expose tables that provide additional instrumentation for software and applications and for the processes that make up that software or those applications. The HOST-RESOURCES-MIB entries in 'hrSWRunTable' and 'hrSWRunPerfTable' and the SYSAPPL-MIB entries in 'sysApplElmtRunTable' have a one-to-one relationship to entries in the component element table. The entries in these standard MIB tables are solely or partially indexed by the operating system process identifier (ID). The process ID is an integer value that uniquely identifies a single process that is currently running on the host. Entries in the component element table maintain its process ID; this value is used to relate the entry to a corresponding entry in the referenced tables of HOST-RESOURCES-MIB and SYSAPPL-MIB. Entries in these tables of the HOST-RESOURCES and SYSAPPL MIBs expose similar information about each process; in some cases, objects are duplicated. However, while the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB lists processes with no further relationship, the SYSAPPL-MIB relates these same processes to installed software packages and the elements that make up those packages. Entries in the component element table cannot be similarly indexed as the referenced standard MIB tables because, should the process terminate (expectedly or unexpectedly), the entry would need to be removed from the table since its index or process ID is thus unknown. This behavior diminishes the agent's ability to express a component element's current status since the entry no longer exists. However, to relate this table to the referenced standard MIB tables, entries in the component element table maintain the current process ID of the element. This provides the one-to-one relationship that allows the management station to drill down further on each functional component and present instrumentation related to each element of that component from these standard MIB tables. This table has a expansion relationship with the component table; there will be one or many entries in this table that relate to a single entry in the component table. Because the set of elements of a contact center functional component are finite and static, this table is constructed by the SNMP agent at startup; entries cannot be added or deleted at run time. The object values of each element entry may change periodically if the run state of the process changes. The SNMP agent will alter the RunID and Status object values to reflect the correct process ID and run status of that process. All objects in this table are read-only to the management station."
