IANA has created a registry of Power State supported by an Energy Object and IANA shall administer the list of Power State Sets and Power States. The Textual Convention assumes that Power States in a Power State Set are limited to 255 distinct values. For a Power State Set S, the named number with the value S * 256 is allocated to indicate the Power State Set. For a Power State X in the Power State Set S, the named number with the value S * 256 + X + 1 is allocated to represent the Power State. Requests for new values should be made to IANA via email (iana@iana.org).",
