Thus, each port of the bridge is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1' then that port is included in the set of ports; the port is not included if its bit has a value of '0' When setting this value, the system will ignore configuration for ports not between the first and last valid ports. Configuration of any port numbers between this range that are not valid ports return a failure message, but will still apply configuration for valid ports."
