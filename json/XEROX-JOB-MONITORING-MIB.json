    "description": " File: 41jobmon.dfm, .mib, .txt, .pdf Version: 4.03.pub This MIB specifies job and document objects for monitoring print jobs, including accounting, of print jobs. This MIB does not provide for management and control of print jobs, such as cancelling or modifying them. If job control is desired, another MIB that augments this one should be developed. The groups in this MIB are arranged so that an additional MIB may be developed that supports monitoring of multifunction jobs (print, scan, FAX, etc.), including scan-only jobs. Such a MIB is intended to augment this MIB. See the companion Job Monitoring MIB textual conventions module: XEROX-JOB-MONITORING-TC for the textual conventions and for an explanation of the use of this MIB (see file 40jobtc.txt). The specification for many of the objects in this MIB is taken directly from the ISO 10175 Document Printing Application (DPA) standard, clause 9.2, Job Attributes and clause 9.3, Document Attributes. Such direct inclusions are explicitly indicated. However, this MIB is intended to be used with non-DPA implementations, so only a small set of general DPA attributes have been included in the Job Monitoring MIB. In addition, a single print-centric group is included. Finally, some of the ISO DPA specifications have been generalized so that they may be used with non-print job services. For example, changing the names and descriptions from 'printer' to 'device'. All such changes to ISO DPA text are indicated inside square brackets to make it clear how this Job Monitoring MIB differs from ISO DPA. Copyright 1996-2002 Xerox Corporation. All Rights Reserved.

This attribute is used as one of the indices into the ClientIdMap table. There are two types of job-submitting clients: 1. XCMI-conforming job submitting clients 2. non-XCMI-conforming job submitting clients For XCMI-conforming job submitting clients, the 'xcmJobClientId' shall be a globally unique job id. This globally unique job id shall be a textual string representation in standard dotted decimal form of an OID (used in traps related to this job generated by this host system). See XcmGlobalUniqueID in the Xerox General textual conventions in 06gentc.mib for a description of the contents required for XCMI-conforming job submitting clients. For non-XCMI-conforming job submitting clients, the job id may be any textual string and may not necessarily be unique, even if the job submitter is a strictly conforming ISO DPA client. ISO DPA: Job-client-id This attribute supplies a human-readable descriptor for the job. This descriptor may be printed by the server on auxiliary sheets to help identify the user's printed output, and discriminate between different jobs. Use and treatment of this attribute is implementation and site specific. If the client specifies the value of the job attribute job- client-id, no server shall change it. If the client does not specify the value of the job attribute job-client-id, the first server shall set it to the value of the job attribute job- identifier, so that no downstream server shall change it. These rules ensure that if an implementation prints the value of the job-client-id on an auxiliary sheet, it has a value that is meaningful to the client originally submitting the job, no matter how many servers the job passes through. For example, client A submits a job to server B and does not specify a value for the job attribute job-client-id. Server B assigns a job-identifier of 123 to the job, and forwards this job to server C. Server C assigns a job-identifier of 456 to the job and forwards this job to printer D. Printer D is not a DPA server, but it has its own queue and assigns a job-id of 789 to the job. The following table shows the value of the relevant job attributes in the two servers B and C: job- job- job- job- client-id identifier- identifier identifier- on-client on-printer --------- ----------- ---------- ----------- server B 123 unspecified 123 456 server C 123 123 456 789* * If printer D did not assign a job-id to its jobs, then the value of the job attribute job-identifier-on-printer for server C would be unspecified."

Standard values are defined in the specification of the medium- identifier medium attribute. If the page-media-select attribute is specified (either by the client or by a server default, i.e., the page-media-select attribute of the initial-value-job object specified by the logical or physical printer), then the server shall use the page-media-select value to override the default-medium specification on a page by page basis. The default-medium attribute may contain a value of id-val- generic-none (see DPA 9.1.2) indicating that the server shall not use a default medium. Instead, the server shall rely on lower precedence document attributes (such as default-input- tray) for the media specification. If the document data, itself, specifies media, such specification shall override the default-medium attribute on a page by page basis. If the document data specifies media which are not also values of media-used, then a printer may receive a document which requires media that are not ready. In such a case, an implementation may either abort the document or try printing the document on some alternative medium, such as the default medium. A client has numerous ways to specify the media to be used when printing a document and different document pages can be specified in different ways. The client can specify the media in the document contents or with attributes. Some attributes override the document contents, and other attributes may be overridden by the document contents. In addition, the client can specify the media by name or by the input-tray containing it. Before printing each page of a document, the server determines the medium or input-tray for that page by finding the first condition in the list of numbered steps below that is satisfied. For this discussion, either the medium or the input- tray is sufficient information: a) If page-media-select has a medium value for the current page, use that medium, regardless of document contents and other attributes. b) If input-tray-select has a value, use that tray. c) If the document contents specify a medium, and that medium is the same as the value of one of the original-medium elements in the media-substitution attribute, then use the corresponding substitution-medium in the media-substitution attribute. d) If the document contents specify a medium, use that medium. e) If the document contents specify an input-tray, use that input-tray. f) If the default-medium has a value, and the document format interpreter allows its use, and that medium is the same as the value of one of the original-medium elements in media- substitution attribute, then use the corresponding substitution-medium in the media-substitution attribute. g) If the default-medium has a value and the document format interpreter allows its use, use the default-medium. h) If the default-input-tray has a value and the document format interpreter allows its use, use the default-input-tray. i) Use the medium or input-tray selected by the document format processor in the printer.

The Printer MIB (RFC 1759) requires that input sub-unit indices remain stable across successive device power cycles. ISO DPA: Default-input-tray This attribute identifies an input-tray that the server shall use as the input-tray default for the pages of the document that require a specification. The correspondence between the simple-name of an input-tray (alphanumeric or numeric) and the actual tray in the printer is printer-dependent, and a tray named by such a simple-name may also have an OBJECT IDENTIFIER that names it as well. A server may try to convert a simple-name received from a client to one of the server's OIDs, depending on implementation.

If the default-medium attribute is specified (either by the client or by a server default, i.e., the default-medium attribute of the initial-value-job object specified by the logical or physical printer), then the server shall use the default-medium value and shall ignore the default-input-tray attribute, if specified.

    "description": "This trap is sent whenever the state of a job changes. The 'state of a job' is comprised by the aggregate values of the xcmJobCurrentState, xcmJobPriority, xcmJobStateReasons, xcmJobXStateReasons, xcmJobX2StateReasons, xcmDevicesAssigned and xcmDeviceStateOfDevicesAssigned fields of the job's table entries: This notification is sent whenever any of these values changes with the following exceptions: 1. Changes in xcmDeviceStateOfDevicesAssigned shall only generate traps when the job is in the processing state (NOTE - xcmJMDevicesAssignedGroup is deprecated) 2. Changes in xcmJobStateReasons, xcmJobXStateReasons, and xcmJobX2StateReasons shall only generate traps when the job is in the processing state (rare). The normal polling cycle will pick up any changes while the job is not in the processing state. Since most changes in reasons also accompany a job state change, the chances that a change in a reason will have to wait for the normal polling cycle is very small. For example, a requester further modifies a held job adding more reasons for it to be held will have to wait for the polling cycle, since the job does not change state (remaining in the held state). NOTE - the hrDeviceIndex is included for convenience, even though the Printer MIB (RFC 1759) doesn't include hrDeviceIndex in its traps. Then the management station doesn't have to parse the received varBind OIDs on a trap in order to discover which device trapped. NOTE - the addition of an entire row to the job tables corresponds to the acceptance of another job by the server. The state of the job changes from unknown to a specific value (usually pending). Therefore, the agent shall generate a trap when a job is accepted (so that the management station can display the newly arrived job in a timely fashion). Similarly when the server removes a job because the job has been in the completed state for a sufficient time or the job has been deleted by a Delete operation, the SNMP agent shall reflect that removal by removing the row from the job tables, and shall generate a trap (since the state of the job has changed to non-existent). The IETF Printer MIB maintains a table which serves as a sort of 'audit-trail' of recent alerts. There is no need for such a table here, since the job's tables will serve virtually the same purpose. As with all SNMP notifications, critical applications cannot completely rely upon delivery: some amount of polling is recommended. The variable-bindings of this trap have been chosen to give the minimum of information: the xcmJobIdentifierOnSystem value and hrDeviceIndex are provided. With these an application is able to obtain the full job table entry. An application has to look at the job tables anyway. The time of the alert is returned as part of any SNMP trap. The hrDeviceIndex maps one-to-one with the PWG Job Mon jmGeneralJobSetIndex. (The PWG Job Mon does not require the Host Resources MIB, so the name of the primary index for all PWG Job Mon tables is not hrDeviceIndex, but serves the same purpose of allowing multiple instances in a single device or server. The Job Alert's special semantics is covered by U.S. patent 5778183. This notification has the following special semantics: o If the job's xcmJobClientId field is not empty, its value will also be appended to trap object ID. NOTE: If the format of the xcmJobClientId is dotted decimal representation, then it will be encoded as a BER binary OID appended to the trap object ID. NOTE: The BER binary OID shall not include the ASN.1/BER tag of 6 indicating an OID and shall not include the ASN.1/BER length field in octets of the OID. This trap OID qualifier allows job-submission and monitoring applications to limit the alerts they receive to ones generated by jobs which they have submitted. NOTE: The sum of the trap var bind values must be less than can fit into a PDU on any transport, roughly 540 octets on some transports. Thus implementers are warned to minimize the length of the xcmJobClientId and xcmJobIdentifierOnSystem objects."
