All unnecessary percent-encoding is removed, and all case-insensitive characters are set to lowercase except for hexadecimal digits, which are normalized to uppercase as described in Section 6.2.2.1. The purpose of this normalization is to help provide unique URIs. Note that this normalization is not sufficient to provide uniqueness. Two URIs that are textually distinct after this normalization may still be equivalent. Objects using this TEXTUAL-CONVENTION MAY restrict the schemes that they permit. For example, 'data:' and 'urn:' schemes might not be appropriate. A zero-length URI is not a valid URI. This can be used to express 'URI absent' where required, for example when used as an index field. Where this TEXTUAL-CONVENTION is used for an index field, it MUST be subtyped to restrict its length. There is an absolute limit of 128 subids for an OID, and it is not efficient to have OIDs whose length approaches this limit.",
