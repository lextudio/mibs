    "description": "This MIB module defines the managed objects that support monitoring of thresholds on interfaces. Configuration and monitoring of the thresholds is done through threshold templates that can be assigned to any subset of interfaces on the network element. More than one threshold template can be assigned to a given interface. This MIB module should be used when it is desired to apply a common set of thresholds to a subset of the available interfaces. If a threshold is to be applied to only one interface, then the EVENT-MIB or the RMON-MIB may be used as simpler alternatives. If a threshold is to be applied to all available interfaces, then the EVENT-MIB may be used as a simpler alternative."

The value 'deltaValue' indicates that the difference between two successive samples of cifthThresholdObject is to be compared to cifthThresholdFiredValue or cifthThresholdClearedValue. The polling interval between successive samples is defined in cifthThresholdSampleInterval. The value 'rateOfIncreaseExponentXIfSpeed' indicates that the rate of increase of cifthThresholdObject is to be compared to the negated value of cifthThresholdFiredValue used as the exponent of 10, times the value of ifSpeed (if the value of ifSpeed is less than the maximum value) or ifHighSpeed (otherwise). For example, a value of cifthThresholdFiredValue of 5 on a gigabit ethernet interface indicates a threshold of 10^-5 times the interface speed, which is equal to 10,000 per second. When the value of this object is 'rateOfIncreaseExponentXIfSpeed', the polling interval between successive samples is determined automatically by the agent. When the object identified by cifthThresholdObject is a counter, a threshold type of 'deltaValue' or 'rateOfIncreaseExponentXIfSpeed' should be used.
